# Newsblur-replete theme

An opinionated theme extension user style for the native NewsBlur dark theme.

I set up the account, and enabled dark mode. This CSS is designed to work on top of it and can be applied with a browser extension like 'Stylus', just copy and paste the CSS in and it should work straight away.

## Features

- White story view
- Compact sidebar
- Typography improvements
- Grid view
- Magazine view
- List view

## Why 

I think Newsblur is the best RSS reader out there, but isn't a great reading experience. I really like this software so decided to spend a few hours improving the reading experience given how much time I'm spending in it.

## Todo

There's a lot that could be improved, but this is good enough for now. I may or may not improve this further.
